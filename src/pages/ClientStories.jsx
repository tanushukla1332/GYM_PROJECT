        Here at Four Friends Fitness, we like to highlight the stories of our
        clients and their success on their health and fitness journeys. Each
        client is an integral part of our success at the Four Friends Studio.
        These clients are at the heart of everything we do and we try our best
        to make a difference in their lives. We applaud these brave women for
        finishing strong and crushing their health and fitness goals. These
        voices and stories from the frontlines have been compiled to help you
        find the motivation to initiate that change you need to attain physical
        fitness and a healthy lifestyle.
